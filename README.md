This Node.js backend, built with the **Express.js** framework, serves as a simple content management system (CMS) for a blog or a similar website. It manages a collection of in-memory posts and provides a set of API routes to perform basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application uses **EJS** for server-side rendering, allowing for dynamic content to be displayed on the frontend.

### Key Components and Functionality

-   **Server Setup**: The code sets up an Express server running on port 3000. It uses **`body-parser`** middleware to handle data submitted from HTML forms and serves static files (like CSS and images) from a `public` directory.

-   **Post Management**:
    -   **Posts Array**: A global `posts` array stores all the blog posts in memory. This is a simple way to handle data without a database, but it means all posts will be lost when the server restarts.
    -   **Create**: The `POST /create-post` route takes a title and content from a form, creates a new post object, and adds it to the `posts` array.
    -   **Read**: The main `/` route renders the `index.ejs` template, displaying all the posts from the `posts` array. There are also dedicated routes for "About" and "Contact" pages.
    -   **Update**: The `GET /edit-post/:index` and `POST /edit-post/:index` routes allow a user to edit an existing post by its array index.
    -   **Delete**: The `GET /delete-post/:index` route removes a post from the `posts` array based on its index.

-   **Contact Form**: The application includes a contact page with a form. When a user submits the form, the `POST /contact` route logs the user's name, email, and message to the console and then renders a "thank you" page.

-   **Templating**: **EJS** is the view engine, allowing the server to inject dynamic data into HTML templates, such as the list of posts on the homepage or a personalized thank you message on the contact-success page.

In summary, this backend provides the fundamental logic for a basic, file-based blogging platform, handling content creation, display, and management through simple HTTP requests and responses.
